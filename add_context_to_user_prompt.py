    _________________________
    Consider what we're trying to accomplish here.
    
    
    Please don't write any code unless I explicitly ask you to. Please choose up to 5 files that you'd like me to show to another LLm that will then be tasked with solving my task.
    I'll immediately and without looking run your answer through a string processing algorithm that will look for filenames, and return their source code to you. 
    
    For this to work, it's important to stick with a convention:
    Each filename has to go inside of html tags like this:
    
    <f>readme.rtfd</f>
    <f>main.py</f>
    <f>transcribe_audio.py</f>
    <f>styling.css</f>
    <f>structure.html</f>
    
    (Names from my example above are made up. Make sure to only provide filenames present in the json above). If there's a readme, that's always a good place to start.
        
    Additionally, since you know the bigger picture of my codebase a little, give tips to the LLM pertaining to that, and place it inside of brackets:
    <tips> TIPS </tips>. 
    
    Your tips should only be a couple paragraphs long.
